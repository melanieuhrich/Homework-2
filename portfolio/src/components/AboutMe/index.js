            <p className='bio'> I am a recent graduate from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign living in the Chicago area.
            After earning my degree in International Relations as well as a minor Spanish, I decided that I
            wanted to further enhance my skills, leading to the decision to become a web developer. I wanted to
            pursue a challenging, creative career path that would give me plenty of options, opportunities, and room
            to grow.
            </p>
            <p className='bio2'>When I'm not working or coding, I enjoy making music, walking my dogs, and roasting coffee! Feel free to
            check out some of my work below.
            </p>
