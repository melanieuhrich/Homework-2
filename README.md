# Purpose of Assignment 

Create a portfolio that displays a bio, my work, and contact information. 

Create an application that functions on different screen sizes. 

# What I Did and Why 

Created a header that included my name and a nav bar with links to each part of the page. 

Wrote a bio to share information about my education, goals, and fun facts about myself.

Created a work section in which to link what I will create in the future. 

Created a contact section so that employers know where to reach me. 

Adjusted the media query so that my application can be viewed on a variety of devices and maintain a proper setup...
    For both max-width: 769px and max-width: 376px I mainly had to adjust the margins and sizes of the photos to make them fit.
